## Detailed Decision Entries

### DL-2026-02-18-004: Map Builder uses Groups (not Rows) for zone collections and group labels
- Domain: Map Builder UX / Terminology
- State: accepted
- Source: `docs/ledger/sources/LOCKED_DECISION_SOURCE_MAP_GROUPS_2026-02-18_chat-bc-1cce.md#qa-group-2026-02-18-002`

#### Decision
In the map feature, use the term "Group" instead of "Row" for collections of zones and their map labels. Groups can represent rows, warehouse sections, or any user-defined set of zones.

#### Why
Not all warehouses organize zones strictly by rows; "Group" keeps the feature flexible and matches user intent.

#### Implementation impact
- Rename UI sections from "Rows" / "Row Labels" to "Groups" / "Group Labels".
- Ensure this does not conflict with the Location Type "Row" (locations.type) concept.

### DL-2026-02-18-005: Allow applying a group label to any mixed selection of zones
- Domain: Map Builder UX
- State: accepted
- Source: `docs/ledger/sources/LOCKED_DECISION_SOURCE_MAP_GROUPS_2026-02-18_chat-bc-1cce.md#qa-group-2026-02-18-001`

#### Decision
When multiple zones are selected (even from different existing groups), allow applying one group label to the entire selection. Users can define groups however they want.

#### Why
Restricting grouping to a single "row" shape makes the tool brittle and slows setup; mixed selection grouping enables quick organization by real-world layouts.

#### Implementation impact
- Group assignment action merges the selected zones into the specified/new group.
- Existing group membership for those zones is replaced by the new grouping.
