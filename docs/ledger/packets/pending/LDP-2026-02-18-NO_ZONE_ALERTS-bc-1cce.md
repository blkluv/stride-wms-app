## Detailed Decision Entries

### DL-2026-02-18-010: Do not emit zone-level (heat map) alerts; rely on per-location capacity alerts
- Domain: Alerts / Heat Map
- State: accepted
- Source: `docs/ledger/sources/LOCKED_DECISION_SOURCE_NO_ZONE_ALERTS_2026-02-18_chat-bc-1cce.md#qa-alert-2026-02-18-002`
- Supersedes: `DL-2026-02-18-009`

#### Decision
Do not build zone/heat-map alert notifications. Capacity alerting should remain at the per-location level to avoid redundant/duplicate alerts.

#### Why
Zone utilization thresholds can easily overlap with per-location capacity thresholds and create confusing duplicate notifications. The heat map is intended as a visual “at a glance” tool.

#### Implementation impact
- Do **not** ship `rpc_evaluate_zone_alerts` and do **not** wire zone threshold events into Communications/Alert Queue.
- Heat map may still **visually** represent utilization via colors/legend and drill-down lists, but should not emit notification alerts based on zone thresholds.
