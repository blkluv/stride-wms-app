# Locked Decision Ledger

Last updated: 2026-02-15
Owner: Builders / Developers
Scope: Development artifact only (not an app feature)

## Purpose

This file is the authoritative, human-readable decision ledger for build work.
It captures high-impact implementation decisions, their status, and supersession chain.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. **Editable until locked**: A decision can be edited while in `draft` or `accepted`.
2. **Locked means immutable**: Once state is `locked`, do not edit decision content in place.
3. **Changes after lock require supersession**: Create a new decision and reference `supersedes`.
4. **Append-only implementation tracking**: Progress is logged in `docs/LOCKED_DECISION_IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`.
5. **Decision source required**: Each decision must reference source material (Q&A, plan doc, PDF, issue).
6. **Docs-only system**: Ledger lives in this GitHub repo under `docs/` for builders/developers.

## Decision lifecycle states

- `draft`: captured candidate, still being refined
- `accepted`: approved for implementation, still editable
- `locked`: final and immutable
- `superseded`: replaced by another decision
- `rejected`: intentionally not adopted

## Post-import working decisions

### DL-2026-02-14-051: Subscription enforcement scope moves to full-app restriction with payment-update redirect
- Domain: SaaS Enforcement
- State: accepted
- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: DL-2026-02-14-018, DL-2026-02-14-019, DL-2026-02-14-048, DL-2026-02-14-050
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
When subscription enforcement triggers, users should be routed to a subscription payment update page and blocked from normal app access until payment information is updated and access is restored.

#### Why
Business intent is to make subscription remediation the immediate path instead of route-by-route operational gating.

#### Implementation impact
- Introduces app-level restriction flow instead of limited route wrappers.
- Requires a dedicated payment-update destination route/page and allowlist behavior.
- Requires supersession plan for Phase 5 route-level gate decisions.

### DL-2026-02-14-052: Full-app redirect starts immediately at past_due (during grace)
- Domain: SaaS Enforcement
- State: accepted
- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: DL-2026-02-14-024
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
Users are redirected to the subscription payment-update path immediately when status becomes `past_due` (during grace), not only after grace expires.

#### Why
Business priority is hard enforcement of billing remediation flow as soon as payment failure occurs.

#### Implementation impact
- Redefines grace as a payment-recovery window rather than an access-allowed window.
- App-level gate condition must block normal app routes for `past_due`, `canceled`, and `inactive`.
- Requires supersession-aware updates to banner/copy so in-grace users are still blocked but informed of grace deadline.

### DL-2026-02-14-053: Blocked page must auto-check subscription recovery and allow manual status refresh
- Domain: SaaS UX
- State: accepted
- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
The blocked payment-update page should automatically re-check subscription status on an interval (target ~10 seconds) and also provide a manual "Check status" action.

#### Why
Stripe recovery events are asynchronous; users need a low-friction path to regain access quickly once payment is fixed.

#### Implementation impact
- Add polling/refetch behavior to blocked flow.
- Add manual status refresh control on blocked page.
- On recovered status, immediately release app-level restriction and continue normal app navigation.

### DL-2026-02-14-054: Blocked-user destination route is /subscription/update-payment
- Domain: SaaS UX
- State: accepted
- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
The enforced payment-recovery flow uses a dedicated app route: `/subscription/update-payment`.

#### Why
A dedicated route keeps blocked-state logic isolated from normal billing/settings pages and simplifies allowlisting.

#### Implementation impact
- Add route/page for subscription payment update flow.
- Route allowlist while blocked must include `/subscription/update-payment`.
- Portal return URL should target `/subscription/update-payment`.

### DL-2026-02-14-055: Provide minimal admin_dev Stripe Ops observability page without credential editing
- Domain: SaaS Ops
- State: accepted
- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
Build a dev-only (`admin_dev`) Stripe Ops page focused on observability and diagnostics, while keeping Stripe account settings, credentials, and key management outside the app.

#### Why
This gives operational visibility for troubleshooting and status checks without introducing security risk from in-app credential editing.

#### Implementation impact
- Add a restricted `admin_dev` route/page for Stripe observability.
- Include read-mostly data (subscription state lookups, webhook processing health, links to Stripe objects).
- Exclude any in-app editing of Stripe API keys or account-level credential material.

### DL-2026-02-14-056: Blocked-state allowlist includes auth, payment-update, logout, and help/support access
- Domain: SaaS Enforcement
- State: accepted
- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
While the app is globally blocked for unpaid subscription status, allowlisted access remains available for authentication, payment update flow, logout/sign-out, and help/support routes.

#### Why
Users must be able to remediate billing, recover sessions safely, and reach support without bypassing enforcement.

#### Implementation impact
- Global block middleware/guard must exempt:
  - `/auth`
  - `/subscription/update-payment`
  - logout/sign-out action route (if present)
  - help/support route(s) where available
- All other authenticated app routes are redirected to `/subscription/update-payment` during blocked states.

### DL-2026-02-14-057: Payment-state mutation RPC identity standard is stripe_subscription_id
- Domain: Webhook/RPC Contract
- State: accepted
- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: DL-2026-02-14-040, DL-2026-02-14-041
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
Payment-state mutation RPCs are standardized on `stripe_subscription_id` as the identity key for failure/paid transitions.

#### Why
Stripe invoice/payment events naturally provide subscription IDs, reducing extra lookup complexity and minimizing mismatch risk.

#### Implementation impact
- Keep/refine mutation RPC signatures to accept `stripe_subscription_id`.
- Webhook invoice handlers call payment mutation RPCs using subscription ID directly.
- Documentation and gate diagnostics should reference this identity model.

### DL-2026-02-14-058: subscription.updated tenant resolution must use customer_id fallback to subscription_id
- Domain: Webhook Contract
- State: accepted
- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
For `customer.subscription.updated`, tenant resolution must first attempt `stripe_customer_id`; if unresolved, fallback to `stripe_subscription_id`.

#### Why
Customer-based mapping improves resilience when subscription IDs rotate, change timing, or are missing from expected mapping windows.

#### Implementation impact
- Update webhook resolution logic for `customer.subscription.updated` (and preferably keep parity for deleted event handling).
- Add logs that indicate which lookup path resolved the tenant.
- Ensure idempotent upsert still applies after resolution path branching.

### DL-2026-02-14-059: /subscription/update-payment auto-opens Stripe Customer Portal on page load
- Domain: SaaS UX
- State: accepted
- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
When users land on `/subscription/update-payment`, the app should automatically open Stripe Customer Portal immediately on page load.

#### Why
This minimizes remediation friction and gets blocked users into payment recovery flow without extra clicks.

#### Implementation impact
- Payment-update page should trigger portal session creation and redirect/open flow automatically.
- Include robust fallback UI for blocked popup/navigation failures (for example, retry button and support contact).
- Keep status polling/manual refresh from DL-2026-02-14-053 for post-return unlock behavior.

### DL-2026-02-14-060: Client portal users use the same blocked destination route as internal users
- Domain: SaaS Enforcement
- State: accepted
- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
Client portal users (`/client/*`) should follow the same blocked destination route (`/subscription/update-payment`) and remediation flow as internal users.

#### Why
Subscription enforcement is tenant-level and should remain consistent across user surfaces.

#### Implementation impact
- Global blocked-state routing logic applies uniformly to internal and client portal routes.
- Avoid creating a separate client-only blocked flow unless later superseded.

### DL-2026-02-14-061: Payment data entry remains Stripe-hosted; app never collects raw card details
- Domain: Security/Compliance
- State: accepted
- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
Users update payment details only in Stripe-hosted surfaces (Customer Portal/Checkout). The app does not capture, process, or store raw card numbers, CVC, or full PAN data.

#### Why
This reduces PCI exposure and security risk while relying on Stripe for payment data handling.

#### Implementation impact
- `/subscription/update-payment` launches Stripe-hosted payment management only.
- App stores only non-sensitive billing metadata needed for subscription state and UX (for example status, grace deadlines, Stripe IDs).
- Maintain secure webhook verification and service-role controls because operational/security risk still exists outside raw card handling.

### DL-2026-02-14-062: Blocked-flow support uses external mailto contact (tenant company email when available)
- Domain: SaaS UX
- State: accepted
- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
Help/support in blocked payment flow is external: use a mailto contact link (prefer tenant company email from settings when available).

#### Why
External support avoids adding another in-app route while access is restricted and ships quickly.

#### Implementation impact
- Payment update page renders support mailto link when company email is available.
- Fallback guidance remains visible if no support email exists.

### DL-2026-02-14-063: Keep DL-051 through DL-062 in accepted state until post-deploy Stripe CLI validation
- Domain: Release Governance
- State: accepted
- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
Decisions DL-2026-02-14-051 through DL-2026-02-14-062 remain `accepted` and will not be moved to `locked` until deployment and Stripe CLI validation are completed.

#### Why
Final lock should occur only after live integration behavior is verified end-to-end.

#### Implementation impact
- Keep these decisions editable in accepted state until validation evidence is captured.
- After verification, update state to locked and append corresponding verification events in the implementation log.

### DL-2026-02-14-064: Phase 5.1 checkout trigger lives on Billing page and uses dynamic Start/Manage label
- Domain: SaaS Checkout
- State: accepted
- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
Expose subscription initiation/management from the Billing page with one action button that changes label by scenario:
- `Start Subscription` for new subscribers (no subscription row / status `none`)
- `Manage Subscription` for existing subscribers (renew/recovery/management flow)

#### Why
This provides a single discoverable entry point while preserving clearer user intent by state.

#### Implementation impact
- Billing page button invokes:
  - checkout session creator for new subscribers
  - customer portal session creator for existing subscribers
- Phase 5.1 checkout creator must set `metadata.tenant_id` for webhook bootstrap reliability.

### DL-2026-02-14-065: Subscription offering remains single base plan with optional SMS add-on track
- Domain: SaaS Pricing Model
- State: accepted
- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
For current rollout, keep one primary subscription plan. Support an optional SMS-related add-on as a separate option.

#### Why
This preserves a simple base subscription while allowing extensibility for message usage/automation features.

#### Implementation impact
- Checkout and plan governance should remain compatible with a single base plan + optional add-on model.
- SMS add-on automation may be delivered in a parallel implementation stream.

### DL-2026-02-14-066: SMS add-on activation happens post-checkout in app Settings with form and terms acceptance
- Domain: SaaS SMS Add-on
- State: accepted
- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
Users activate SMS add-on after subscription checkout from the app Settings page, where they complete required onboarding form fields and explicitly agree to terms.

#### Why
SMS onboarding has additional compliance/setup requirements that are separate from base subscription purchase.

#### Implementation impact
- Add or extend Settings SMS activation workflow with required form + terms acceptance capture.
- Activation should not be part of initial checkout flow.
- SMS billing eligibility should be gated by successful activation state.

### DL-2026-02-14-067: Billing page must show consolidated subscription details including SMS add-on status
- Domain: SaaS Billing UX
- State: accepted
- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
Billing page should present complete subscription information, including base subscription state and SMS add-on status/activation visibility.

#### Why
Users need one billing view for account standing and add-on state.

#### Implementation impact
- Extend Billing page UI with subscription summary panel.
- Include SMS add-on status fields and billing-relevant metadata in that summary.

### DL-2026-02-14-068: SMS terms acceptance audit must capture version/time/user/ip/user-agent/source
- Domain: SaaS Compliance
- State: accepted
- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
When SMS add-on terms are accepted, persist the minimum required audit fields:
`terms_version`, `accepted_at`, `accepted_by`, `ip_address`, `user_agent`, and `acceptance_source`.

#### Why
These fields are the baseline evidence needed for operational traceability and compliance review when terms or consent flows are challenged.

#### Implementation impact
- Add tenant-level SMS activation/acceptance schema and append-only acceptance log.
- Capture acceptance metadata server-side during activation to avoid client-trust gaps.
- Surface resulting activation/acceptance status in Settings and Billing summary UX.

### DL-2026-02-14-069: Tenant admins can self-deactivate SMS add-on from Settings
- Domain: SaaS SMS Add-on

- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
Tenant admins should be able to self-deactivate the SMS add-on directly from the in-app Settings flow.

#### Why
Self-service deactivation reduces support dependency and gives tenant admins direct control over optional add-on lifecycle changes.

#### Implementation impact
- Add a tenant-admin deactivation RPC and audit log event for self-service deactivation.
- Expose a deactivation action in Settings SMS add-on activation UI with explicit confirmation.
- Reflect `disabled` SMS add-on status in Billing summary visibility.

### DL-2026-02-14-070: Historical SMS billing/report records remain visible as read-only after deactivation
- Domain: SaaS Billing UX

- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
When SMS add-on is deactivated, existing SMS billing/report records stay visible to tenant users as read-only history.

#### Why
Preserving historical records supports auditability, operational reconciliation, and user trust without allowing retroactive edits.

#### Implementation impact
- Do not delete or hide historical SMS billing/report data during self-deactivation flow.
- Billing UX should communicate that deactivated SMS history remains visible in read-only mode.

### DL-2026-02-14-071: Substantive implementation Q&A must be logged append-only in docs
- Domain: Governance
- State: accepted

- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
All substantive implementation Q&A from active build threads must be captured in an append-only docs log and linked to decision IDs.

#### Why
This prevents decision drift and ensures implementation can be traced to explicit approvals.

#### Implementation impact
- Maintain dated append-only Q&A logs in `docs/`.
- Cross-link Q&A entries and decision IDs in ledger/log artifacts.

### DL-2026-02-14-072: SMS platform is centrally managed in Stride Twilio account with no tenant credential setup

- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
Stride centrally manages Twilio for SMS; tenant users do not configure Twilio credentials in their own settings.

#### Why
Tenant self-setup is high-friction and error-prone; central management simplifies onboarding and support.

#### Implementation impact
- Remove tenant-facing Twilio credential setup flows from standard settings UX.
- Provide centralized internal controls for Twilio operations and compliance.

### DL-2026-02-14-073: SMS number provisioning and activation workflow must be fully automated

- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
New tenant SMS sender provisioning and activation must be automated end-to-end; manual provisioning is not acceptable.

#### Why
Manual provisioning does not scale and introduces operational delay and inconsistency.

#### Implementation impact
- Build automated provisioning workflow, status tracking, and retry/error handling.
- Tie activation state directly to send-eligibility and billing activation.

### DL-2026-02-14-074: Toll-free numbers are the default automated sender strategy

- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
Automated sender provisioning defaults to toll-free numbers, not 10DLC.

#### Why
10DLC onboarding is slower/less predictable for current rollout goals.

#### Implementation impact
- Default provisioning/verification workflow targets toll-free numbers.

### DL-2026-02-14-075: SMS remains disabled until toll-free verification is approved

- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
Tenant SMS sending must remain disabled while toll-free verification is pending or rejected.

#### Why
This reduces compliance risk and prevents pre-approval messaging behavior.

#### Implementation impact
- Gate outbound sends by verification status.
- Expose clear pending/approved/rejected status in tenant billing/settings UX.

### DL-2026-02-14-076: SMS billing start trigger is verification approval timestamp

#### Decision
SMS recurring/usage billing starts when verification transitions to approved (approval timestamp is billing start trigger).

#### Why
Charging before approved service availability causes avoidable disputes.

#### Implementation impact
- Persist approval timestamp and use it as billing activation marker.
- Suppress SMS charges while status is pending/rejected.

### DL-2026-02-14-077: Global pricing includes app monthly plus SMS monthly and per-segment fees

- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
Whenever SMS add-on is reactivated, the user must re-accept terms again (no prior acceptance carry-forward).

#### Why
Per-activation terms acceptance provides stronger consent evidence and avoids ambiguity when activation state changes over time.

#### Implementation impact

### DL-2026-02-15-001: Remove Quick Add Bay and standardize Storage Locations terminology
- Domain: Locations UX
- State: accepted
- Source: `docs/ledger/sources/LOCKED_DECISION_SOURCE_LOCATIONS_CONTAINERS_QA_2026-02-15_chat-bc-93553291-7523-4d63-93a4-b47dc68b42ad.md#qa-2026-02-15-001`
- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-15
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
The locations management UI removes the "Quick Add Bay" section and uses "Storage Locations" terminology for the location list experience.

#### Why
The existing labels and quick-add pattern were confusing and did not match operational terminology.

#### Implementation impact
- Remove quick-add bay card/controls from locations settings.
- Rename list labels/placeholders/actions from bay-specific wording to storage-location wording.

### DL-2026-02-15-002: Location types are limited to aisle, bay, shelf, bin, dock, area; zone deferred to separate grouping column
- Domain: Locations Data Model
- State: accepted
- Source: `docs/ledger/sources/LOCKED_DECISION_SOURCE_LOCATIONS_CONTAINERS_QA_2026-02-15_chat-bc-93553291-7523-4d63-93a4-b47dc68b42ad.md#qa-2026-02-15-002`

- Locked at: -

#### Decision
Active location type vocabulary is restricted to `aisle`, `bay`, `shelf`, `bin`, `dock`, and `area`. `zone` is deferred to a future, separate grouping column.

#### Why
Type semantics must be explicit and stable while keeping zone/grouping concerns separate.

#### Implementation impact
- Restrict type options for add/edit and import inference outputs.
- Normalize existing display behavior to use only approved type labels.
- Exclude `zone` and `release` from forward-looking type selection.

### DL-2026-02-15-003: Location export and template downloads use .xlsx with synced column definitions

- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-15
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
Location export and template download outputs are Excel (`.xlsx`) files and must use the same synchronized column-definition source as the locations list.

#### Why
A single column contract prevents drift between UI columns, export schema, and import templates.

#### Implementation impact
- Use shared location column definitions for list/table/template/export.
- Generate `.xlsx` workbook output for both export and template.

### DL-2026-02-15-004: Location import must preserve legacy area inference and archived/inactive status round-trip

- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-15
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
Location import must infer legacy area/zone-style identifiers as area-like location type and preserve archived/inactive lifecycle state during export/re-import cycles.

#### Why
Misclassification to bin and archived-to-active conversion are semantic regressions that alter operations data.

#### Implementation impact
- Expand import type inference for legacy area/zone patterns.
- Map exported archived status back to inactive/`is_active=false` on import.

### DL-2026-02-15-005: Locations capture dimensions and compute square/cubic totals

- Locked at: -

#### Decision
Containers are treated operationally as movable storage sub-locations; when a container location changes, all contained item locations must update to reflect the container's new parent location.

#### Why
Warehouse teams need bulk movement without manual per-item relocation work while preserving item-level traceability.

#### Implementation impact
- Maintain explicit container-to-parent-location linkage.
- Implement/keep atomic container move behavior that cascades item location updates.

### DL-2026-02-15-008: Container assignment scan flow is item scan then container scan
- Domain: ScanHub

#### Decision
For assigning items into containers via scanners, the operational sequence is scan item code first, then scan container code.

#### Why
This mirrors physical workflow and provides a clear move action mental model for users.

#### Implementation impact
- ScanHub state machine must support item-then-container assignment flow.
- Assignment action records container linkage and updates location context.

### DL-2026-02-15-009: Remove parent location hierarchy UI and clear existing parent_location_id data

#### Decision
Remove parent-location selection from location add/edit UI and clear existing `parent_location_id` values.

#### Why
Parent hierarchy is unused and creates confusion; user explicitly approved clearing existing values.

#### Implementation impact
- Remove parent-location input/control from location forms.
- Run data cleanup to null/reset existing `parent_location_id` values.

- Date created: 2026-02-15
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
Default inbound/outbound location selectors use searchable combobox behavior: open full list on click, then filter as user types by both location code and location name.

#### Why
Large location lists require fast lookup by either known code or remembered name.

#### Implementation impact
- Replace simple select dropdowns with combobox/autocomplete controls.
- Ensure filter keys include both `code` and `name`.

#### Decision
Container creation/management belongs in a location-adjacent workflow and should not be nested inside item-detail views.

#### Why
Containers are shared storage artifacts and should be managed where physical location operations occur.

#### Implementation impact
- Move container management entry points out of item detail context.
- Add/expand container management surface under locations workflow.

- Locked at: -

#### Decision
Pending final confirmation: represent contained-item location either as a combined display string (for example `A1.2E (CNT-123)`) or via separate parent-location/container fields with composed display.

#### Why
Both representations were discussed, but no explicit final selection was approved.

#### Implementation impact
- Keep display/data-model decision open until explicitly confirmed.
- Avoid locking downstream schema/UI assumptions to one representation.

### DL-2026-02-15-015: Scanner identity model for containers is unresolved (location type vs separate entity)
- Domain: Containers Data Model

- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-15
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
Pending final confirmation: scanner differentiation should either treat containers as `locations.type=container` or keep containers as a separate entity recognized by scanner logic.

#### Why
The proposal requested `location type=container`, but final explicit approval of this model was not captured.

#### Implementation impact
- Keep scanner parser and data-model contracts flexible until decision is finalized.
- Do not lock migration strategy for container identity yet.

#### Decision
Pending final confirmation: new containers should auto-generate code in a `CNT-#####` style while allowing manual override/edit.

#### Why
Auto-generated, editable container codes were proposed but not explicitly finalized in a confirmation response.

#### Implementation impact
- Keep generator/validation behavior in draft status until approval.
- Defer locking code-format policy and uniqueness constraints.

#### Decision
Chat/feature branches must stage decision updates as packet/source artifacts instead of directly editing shared master ledger files.

#### Why
Direct concurrent edits to shared index/log sections repeatedly create PR merge conflicts.

#### Implementation impact
- Use `docs/ledger/sources/` and `docs/ledger/packets/pending/` for chat updates.
- Reserve master file edits for controlled packet-apply integration passes.

#### Why
Historical decision integrity is a hard requirement for auditability.

#### Implementation impact
- Maintain current canonical ledger/log contents intact.
- Add migration artifacts and workflow controls around, not over, existing history.

## Supersession example

If `DL-2026-02-14-010` needs to change after it is locked:

1. Keep `DL-2026-02-14-010` unchanged.
2. Add `DL-2026-03-01-002` with `supersedes: DL-2026-02-14-010`.
3. Mark `DL-2026-02-14-010` state as `superseded` (metadata-only state transition).
